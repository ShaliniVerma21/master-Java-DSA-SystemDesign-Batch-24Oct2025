Welcome to the Master Java-DSA-SystemDesign-Batch-24Oct2025 repository!
This repository is a complete learning and implementation hub designed for students, developers, and professionals who want to master Java programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and System Design — from the very basics to advanced real-world applications.

🎯 Objective

To build a strong foundation in Java programming, enhance problem-solving and logical thinking through DSA, and understand System Design concepts for real-world software development and interview preparation.

🧠 What You’ll Learn

This batch is structured to take learners from zero to mastery through a practical and project-based approach.

🔹 Java Programming (Core + Advanced)

Fundamentals: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Loops, Conditions, Functions

OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation

Exception Handling, Multithreading, File Handling, Collections Framework

JDBC & Mini Projects for Real-time Implementation

🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

Trees, Graphs, Heaps, HashMaps, Recursion

Searching & Sorting Algorithms

Time & Space Complexity Analysis

Problem-Solving with LeetCode-style Challenges

🔹 System Design (Basic to Advanced)

Introduction to System Architecture & Scalability

Low-Level Design (LLD) — Classes, Relationships, UML, Design Patterns

High-Level Design (HLD) — Distributed Systems, APIs, Load Balancing, Databases

Real-world Case Studies (e.g., Netflix, Zomato, WhatsApp, Amazon Systems)

💼 Real-World Scenarios

This repository focuses on industry-relevant implementations, including:

Designing real-time applications like Student Management Systems, E-commerce Platforms, and Job Portals

Optimizing data storage and retrieval through DSA-based solutions

Building scalable architectures using System Design fundamentals

Preparing for technical interviews with FAANG-style question sets
