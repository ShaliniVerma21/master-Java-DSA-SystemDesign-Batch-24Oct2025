## 🌟 Welcome to **Master Java-DSA-SystemDesign-Batch-24Oct2025**  

This repository is a complete **learning and implementation hub** designed for students, developers, and professionals who want to master **Java Programming**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, and **System Design** — from the basics to advanced, real-world applications.

---

## 🎯 Objective  

To build a **strong foundation in Java programming**, enhance **problem-solving and logical thinking** through DSA, and gain a deep understanding of **System Design** principles essential for software development and technical interviews.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn  

A complete roadmap taking learners **from zero to mastery** through practical, project-based learning.

### 🔹 **Java Programming (Core + Advanced)**
- Fundamentals: Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Loops, Conditions, Functions  
- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation  
- Exception Handling, Multithreading, File Handling, Collections Framework  
- JDBC & Mini Projects for Real-time Implementation  

### 🔹 **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
- Trees, Graphs, Heaps, HashMaps, Recursion  
- Searching & Sorting Algorithms  
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis  
- Problem-Solving with LeetCode-style Challenges  

### 🔹 **System Design (Basic to Advanced)**
- Introduction to System Architecture & Scalability  
- Low-Level Design (LLD): Classes, Relationships, UML, Design Patterns  
- High-Level Design (HLD): Distributed Systems, APIs, Load Balancing, Databases  
- Real-world Case Studies: Netflix, Zomato, WhatsApp, Amazon Systems  

---

## 💼 Real-World Scenarios  

This repository emphasizes **industry-oriented implementations**, including:
- Designing real-time apps like **Student Management Systems**, **E-commerce Platforms**, **Job Portals**
- Optimizing data storage & retrieval using **efficient DSA solutions**
- Building **scalable architectures** with System Design fundamentals
- Preparing for **FAANG and Product-based interviews** through hands-on examples
